# CS-305-Software-Security-2025

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  - International consulting firm Artemis Financial creates customized financial plans for its clients. The financial plans cover insurance, investments, retirement, and savings. Artemis Financial wants us to integrate the most up-to-date and efficient software security into its public web interface in order to modernize its operations. Protecting customer information and financial data is our top priority. 
  
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  - I prioritized clear communication, prioritization, and remedial plans when I carried out dependency checks and found vulnerabilities in the client's software. I found and confirmed the following problems: To make sure the vulnerabilities were relevant to the real code paths being used, I checked the reported vulnerabilities (from OWASP Dependency-Check). This method demonstrated my ability to identify issues and provide workable, long-term solutions. Because it guards against exploits, safeguards private information, assures compliance, and fosters user confidence, secure code is crucial. This relates to how software security enhances a business's overall health. This is due to the fact that it provides long-term sustainability and financial protection.  
  
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  - Analyzing false positives and evaluating real threats was one of the most difficult elements of the vulnerability assessment. Many possible vulnerabilities are frequently reported by automated programs such as dependency checkers, however not all of them are exploitable or relevant to the current system. In order to determine the practical impact on the client's system, I had to thoroughly examine dependency chains and evaluate whether the vulnerable component was actually used in runtime. If I found a false positive, I would suppress it through my suppression.xml file.  Both technical examination and an awareness of the software architecture were necessary for this.
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  - I used a defense-in-depth strategy, integrating multiple security methods to add further layers of protection. I created digital certificates to secure HTTPS/TLS communication channels, guaranteeing system-to-system authentication and data integrity. In order to protect sensitive data from manipulation or unwanted access, I additionally implemented a SHA-256 cryptography. Furthermore, in order to find vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and custom code, I conducted both automated dependency checks and manual reviews, making sure that any potential flaws were addressed from several perspectives. In the future, I intend to combine threat modeling and risk-based prioritization with automated vulnerability evaluations using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check. This will enable me to implement suitable mitigation strategies like patching, configuration hardening, or code refactoring and assess vulnerabilities according to their severity, exploitability, and business effect. Software is kept safe, dependable, and resistant to changing threats thanks to this multi-layered and proactive strategy.
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  -  I used an organized validation and testing procedure to make sure the code and software application were secure and functional. After putting security measures in place, I started by doing unit and integration testing to make sure all features functioned as planned. Automated test suites assisted in confirming the stability and dependability of important features, APIs, and workflows. I performed dynamic testing to assess runtime behavior for problems like injection or authentication flaws and static code analysis to identify unsafe coding practices from a security perspective. In order to verify that security rules were applied correctly, I additionally verified settings, encryption, and certificate usage. I performed dependency scans and vulnerability assessments again after reworking the code to make sure that no new vulnerabilities had been created by updated libraries or logical changes.
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - The recourse Iron-Clad Java taught me the importance of utilizing known security frameworks and secure coding standards rather than developing original solutions. Reducing the potential for attack, for example, requires the use of concepts like least privilege, secure configuration defaults, and appropriate error handling. I also started utilizing OWASP Dependency-Check to find vulnerabilities early in the development process. Furthermore, procedures like input validation, HTTPS enforcement, the use of robust cryptographic methods, and frequent code reviews have become crucial components of my workflow
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  - I could provide potential employers with a number of compelling instances from this assignment that highlight my technical proficiency, security awareness, and problem-solving abilities. I could specifically point to my work using SHA-256 encryption, dependency checks, and certificate generation to find and fix software flaws, demonstrating my knowledge of secure development approaches.
