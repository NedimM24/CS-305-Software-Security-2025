# CS-305-Software-Security-2025

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  - International consulting firm Artemis Financial creates customized financial plans for its clients. The financial plans cover insurance, investments, retirement, and savings. Artemis Financial wants us to integrate the most up-to-date and efficient software security into its public web interface in order to modernize its operations. Protecting customer information and financial data is our top priority. 
  
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  - I prioritized clear communication, prioritization, and remedial plans when I carried out dependency checks and found vulnerabilities in the client's software. I found and confirmed the following problems: To make sure the vulnerabilities were relevant to the real code paths being used, I checked the reported vulnerabilities (from OWASP Dependency-Check). This method demonstrated my ability to identify issues and provide workable, long-term solutions. Because it guards against exploits, safeguards private information, assures compliance, and fosters user confidence, secure code is crucial. This relates to how software security enhances a business's overall health. This is due to the fact that it provides long-term sustainability and financial protection.
